0,Podemos completa su desconexión de Sumar y toma posición de cara a la investidura de Sánchez,"El partido refuerza su autonomía frente a Yolanda Díaz en vísperas de la votación de investidura y abre la puerta a replantearse sus alianzas con otras fuerzas de la izquierda, como los comuns.
El refuerzo político e identitario de Podemos al margen de Sumar y de la correlación actual de fuerzas en el espacio de la izquierda alternativa ya es un mandato militante de la organización. Este sábado el partido ha anunciado la aprobación del texto que sienta las bases de la hoja de ruta que los de Ione Belarra seguirán de ahora en adelante, a días de la eventual investidura que afrontará Pedro Sánchez.
El documento sienta las bases o líneas generales de una estrategia cuyo alcance se verá en los próximos meses, pero que deja abierta la puerta a un giro profundo en el escenario no sólo de la legislatura, sino de la izquierda.
Para ejemplo, el de la doble militancia. El texto recoge la prohibición de la doble militancia en el seno de la organización, es decir, que un inscrito de Podemos no puede estar afiliado a otra formación política. Esta regla se ha interpretado en muchos sentidos, y en un principio se llegó a relacionar con la posibilidad de que personas de Podemos que actualmente están muy vinculadas a Sumar, como el secretario de Estado de Derechos Sociales, Nacho Álvarez, no pudieran tener una doble afiliación formal.
Sin embargo, este sábado la secretaria general de Podem (la marca de Podemos en Catalunya), Conchi Abellán, avanzó en el acto de presentación del documento que la norma de la doble militancia anticipa una “hoja de ruta propia” y decisiones propias para un Podem que comparte muchos espacios con los comuns de Ada Colau (aunque en ningún caso tiene lugar en la actualidad una doble militancia en Catalunya).
Las declaraciones de Abellán eran un aviso a navegantes de lo que el partido pretende trasladar con el documento político aprobado este sábado: Podemos tiene una serie de objetivos propios que no subsumirá en ninguna otra hoja de ruta, tampoco la de Sumar.
Diferencias políticas y estratégicas con Sumar
Si algo deja claro el texto (y también el acto de este sábado) es que las diferencias organizativas y personales entre la formación morada y los de Yolanda Díaz no son solo fruto de las tensiones vividas en el último año y medio, llevadas al extremo en el acuerdo electoral que excluyó a Irene Montero de las listas; Podemos tiene diferencias políticas y estratégicas de calado con Sumar.
En el documento se rechazan dos de los principios que Yolanda Díaz han convertido en sus símbolos de identidad: el trabajo discreto y en silencio y la huida de la polarización y la confrontación políticas. En el texto Podemos defiende el ruido para lograr objetivos políticos: “la gente corriente siempre tiene poco que ganar en los despachos a puerta cerrada y mucho que ganar cuando los debates se abren a la calle. Sin ruido, un Gobierno de coalición es retroceso y asimilación de la fuerza más transformadora a la más conservadora”, reza el texto.
“El silencio siembra antipolítica, levantarse con unos y con otras y hacer mucho ruido es la semilla de la esperanza, las cosas son posibles porque el pueblo quiere que sean posibles. Callar es renunciar y conformarse, dejar que manden los que han mandado hasta ahora. Los besos y los abrazos se dan enseñando los dientes a los poderosos”, apuntalaba Irene Montero, número dos del partido, en el acto de este sábado.
Una de las conclusiones de esta reflexión que ha hecho el partido es que el proceso de confluencia de las izquierdas en torno a Sumar de los últimos meses ha sido “una operación que tenía por objetivo sustituir a Podemos por una izquierda servil al régimen. No somos ese tipo de proyecto político y, ante todo, no lo queremos ser”, avanzó Ione Belarra.
El cambio de rumbo de la organización se produce en vísperas de una eventual investidura del secretario general del PSOE, Pedro Sánchez, que trata en la actualidad de conseguir los apoyos necesarios para superar este trámite parlamentario. Uno de los puntos del texto recoge que “en cualquier caso, los votos de los y las representantes de Podemos en las instituciones se deben negociar y nunca se regalan”.
Un Gobierno de coalición «de anécdota»
Belarra y Montero denunciaron en el acto que, a su juicio, el Ejecutivo que están negociando Sánchez y Díaz es un Gobierno “en el que sólo manda el PSOE, en el que Sánchez hace y deshace a su antojo”. “Ahora quieren que ese Gobierno de coalición sea una anécdota y dicen que nuestro camino de transformación ha terminado. La única fórmula mágica que se les ha ocurrido es intentar sustituir a Podemos por otro partido que no incomode a los que mandan sin presentarse a las elecciones”, defendieron.
Con este documento, que ha recibido numerosas aportaciones de la militancia en el último mes, Podemos da carpetazo a la hoja de ruta que se fijó el partido en la última Asamblea Ciudadana, y que tenía como base “hacer presidenta a Yolanda Díaz” y tejer un espacio en el que Belarra reforzara la organización política mientras la dirigente de Sumar buscaba ensanchar el espacio en su conjunto.
Esta colaboración se ha ido dañando en el último año y medio, y terminó de dinamitarse tras el acuerdo electoral del mes de junio par concurrir al 23J. Ahora la ruptura con esa estrategia queda escrita, rubricada y refrendada por la militancia de Podemos; se abre un nuevo escenario incierto en el espacio de la izquierda alternativa.","The party reinforces its autonomy against Yolanda Díaz on the eve of the investiture vote and opens the door to rethink their alliances with other forces on the left, such as the commons.The political and

The political and identity reinforcement of Podemos outside of Sumar and the current correlation of forces in the space of the alternative left is already a militant mandate of the organization.

The document lays the foundations or outlines of a strategy whose scope will be seen in the coming months, but which leaves the door open to a profound turn on the stage not only of the legislature, but of the left.
For example, that of double militancy. The text contains the prohibition of double membership within the organisation, i.e. that a member of Podemos may not be affiliated with another political formation. This rule has been interpreted in many ways, and was initially linked to the possibility that people from Podemos who are currently closely linked to Sumar, such as the Secretary of State for Social Rights, Nacho Álvarez, could not have a formal double affiliation.
However, this Saturday, the secretary general of Podem (the Podemos brand in Catalonia), Conchi Abellán, advanced in the presentation of the document that the rule of dual militancy anticipates a “own road map” and own decisions for a Podem that shares many spaces with the communities of Ada Colau (although in no case currently takes place a double militancy in Catalonia).
Abellán's statements were a warning to navigators of what the party intends to convey with the political document approved this Saturday: Podemos has a series of own objectives that will not subsume in any other road map, nor that of Sumar.
Political and strategic differences with Sumar
If something makes clear the text (and also the act of this Saturday) is that the organizational and personal differences between the purple formation and those of Yolanda Díaz are not only the result of the tensions experienced in the last year and a half, carried to the extreme in the electoral agreement that excluded Irene Montero from the lists; Podemos has political and strategic differences of depth with Sumar.
The document rejects two of the principles that Yolanda Díaz has made her symbols of identity: the discreet and silent work and the flight from political polarization and confrontation. In the text Podemos defends the noise to achieve political goals: “The ordinary people always have little to gain in the offices behind closed doors and much to gain when the debates open to the streets. Without noise, a coalition government is retreat and assimilation from the most transformative force to the most conservative,” the text says.
“Silence sows antipolitics, rise with one another and make a lot of noise is the seed of hope, things are possible because the people want them to be possible. To shut up is to resign and settle, to let those who have sent so far send. The kisses and hugs are given by showing the teeth to the powerful,” said Irene Montero, number two of the party, at the event this Saturday.
One of the conclusions of this reflection that the party has made is that the process of confluence of the lefts around Sumar in recent months has been “an operation that aimed to replace Podemos with a servile left to the regime. We are not that kind of political project and, above all, we do not want to be one,” Ione Belarra said.
The change of direction of the organization occurs on the eve of a possible investiture of the general secretary of the PSOE, Pedro Sánchez, who currently tries to obtain the necessary support to overcome this parliamentary procedure. One of the points in the text states that “in any case, the votes of the representatives of Podemos in the institutions must be negotiated and never given away”.
A coalition government “of anecdote”
Belarra and Montero denounced in the act that, in their opinion, the executive branch that is negotiating Sánchez and Díaz is a government “in which only the PSOE commands, in which Sánchez does and disposes at will.” “Now they want that coalition government to be an anecdote and they say that our path of transformation is over. The only magic formula that has occurred to them is to try to replace Podemos with another party that does not bother those who rule without running for election,” they defended.
With this document, which has received numerous contributions from the militancy in the last month, Podemos gives a folder to the road map that the party set itself in the last Citizens’ Assembly, and which was based on “making Yolanda Díaz president” and weaving a space in which Belarra reinforced the political organization while the leader of Sumar sought to widen the space as a whole.
This collaboration has been damaged in the last year and a half, and ended in dynamite after the electoral agreement of June to attend 23J. Now the break with that strategy is written, initialled and endorsed by the militancy of Podemos; a new uncertain scenario opens up in the space of the alternative left.","The party reinforces its autonomy against Yolanda Díaz on the eve of the voting of investors and opens the door to rethinking its alliances with other left forces, such as the communes.
The political and identity reinforcement of Podemos on the sidelines of Sumar and the current correlation of forces in the space of the alternative left is already a militant mandate of the organization. This Saturday the party announced the approval of the text that sets the bases of the route sheet that Ione Belarra will follow from now on, days of the eventual investorship that will face Pedro Sánchez.

Political and strategic differences with Sumar
If something makes clear the text (and also the act of this Saturday) is that the organizational and personal differences between the Morada formation and those of Yolanda Díaz are not only the fruit of the tensions lived in the last year and a half, brought to the extreme in the electoral agreement that excluded Irene Montero from the lists; Podemos has political and strategic differences with Sumar.
The document rejects two of the principles that Yolanda Díaz has turned into her symbols of identity: discreet and silent work and the escape from polarization and political confrontation.

Silence sows anti-politics, getting up with some and with others and making a lot of noise is the seed of hope, things are possible because the people want them to be possible. To be silent is to resign and conform, to let those who have commanded so far rule. The kisses and hugs are given by teaching the teeth to the powerful,” Irene Montero, number two of the party, said on Saturday.
One of the conclusions of this reflection that the party has made is that the process of the confluence of the left around Sumar of the last months has been “an operation that aimed at replacing Podemos by a left servile to the regime. We are not that kind of political project and, first of all, we do not want to be,” Ione Belarra said.
The change of direction of the organization occurs on the eve of an eventual investment of the secretary general of the PSOE, Pedro Sánchez, who is currently trying to get the necessary supports to overcome this parliamentary procedure. One of the points of the text recognises that “in any case, the votes of the and the representatives of Podemos in the institutions must be negotiated and never gifted.”
A “anecdotal” coalition government
Belarra and Montero denounced in the act that, in their judgment, the Executive who are negotiating Sánchez and Díaz is a Government “in which only the PSOE commands, in which Sánchez does and fails to his desire”. “Now they want that coalition government to be an anecdote and they say that our path of transformation has ended. The only magic formula that has happened to them is to try to replace Podemos with another party that does not bother those who rule without presenting themselves to the elections,” they said.
With this document, which has received numerous contributions from the militance in the last month, Podemos gives a map to the roadmap that the party set in the last Citizen Assembly, and that had as a basis “to make president to Yolanda Díaz” and weave a space in which Belarra reinforced the political organization while the leader of Sumar sought to widen the space in its entirety.
This collaboration has been damaging in the last year and a half, and it ended up dynamizing after the June election agreement to meet the 23J.

Javier de Andrés sustituirá este sábado en la presidencia del PP vasco a Carlos Iturgaiz, que ha señalado que deja la dirección tras “unir y coser” el partido, después de la “profunda crisis” que vivió, y con el objetivo de haber crecido en votos y en representación institucional.
Iturgaiz se ha despedido de los afiliados del partido durante el XVI Congreso Regional del PP vasco, reunido este sábado en Vitoria. Este ha elegido a De Andrés para dirigir la formación, con el respaldo de Génova y arropado por el presidente nacional, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, y otros altos cargos de la formación, como la secretaria general, Cuca Gamarra.
En su intervención, Iturgaiz ha destacado que los votos logrados por el PP vasco en las últimas elecciones municipales y forales han hecho que el PP se haya convertido en Euskadi en un partido relevante y decisivo que ha “impedido gobernar” a EH Bildu en algunos ayuntamientos, como en el de Vitoria, y en otras instituciones, como la Diputación de Gipuzkoa.
“Me voy con la satisfacción del deber cumplido”, ha exclamado el presidente del PP vasco saliente. Ha tenido, además, un recuerdo para las víctimas del terrorismo que experimentó el PP vasco, “al que intentaron aniquilar” política y físicamente. Un “genocidio político” perpetrado por los “aliados políticos de Sánchez”.
También ha agradecido “la confianza, el apoyo y la cercanía” de Feijóo hacia todos los populares vascos. “Será un gran presidente de España para sacar a este país de la ruina del sanchismo”, ha opinado. Iturgaiz ha dado, asimismo, su respaldo a Javier de Andrés para emprender la nueva etapa.
En octubre de 2020, 16 años después de dejar la anterior presidencia del partido, volvió a dirigir la formación, meses después de que Alfonso Alonso dimitiera por discrepancias con Génova ante la negociación para la coalición del PP y Ciudadanos, que se presentó a las elecciones vascas de ese año.
El entonces presidente del PP, Pablo Casado, apostó por Iturgaiz, que había dejado la primera línea política al verse relegado a puestos en los que no tenía posibilidades de salir en las listas del PP para el Parlamento Europeo, para que fuera el candidato a lehendakari en las elecciones autonómicas de 2020.

2,"Belarra, tras la aprobación de la nueva hoja de ruta del partido: “Teníamos que frenar la operación para sustituir a Podemos”","Podemos ya tiene una nueva hoja de ruta para afrontar la próxima legislatura. La secretaria general del partido, Ione Belarra, ha anunciado este sábado los resultados de la votación del documento que contiene las bases de la estrategia política que seguirá la organización a partir de ahora, una estrategia en la que se pone distancia y se refuerza la autonomía respecto a Sumar.
Belarra ha defendido que “teníamos que frenar en seco la operación que tenía por objetivo sustituir a Podemos por una izquierda servil al régimen. No somos ese tipo de proyecto político y, ante todo, no lo queremos ser”.
La secretaria general de Podemos ha mostrado su “preocupación” por el hecho de que, a su juicio, el Gobierno de coalición que está conformando Pedro Sánchez con Yolanda Díaz será un Ejecutivo “en el que sólo manda el PSOE, en el que Sánchez hace y deshace a su antojo”.
La número dos del partido, Irene Montero, ha defendido que “ahora quieren que ese Gobierno de coalición sea una anécdota y que nuestro camino de transformación ha terminado. La única fórmula mágica que se les ha ocurrido es intentar sustituir a Podemos por otro partido que no incomode a los que mandan sin presentarse a las elecciones”.
En la votación del documento que recoge la nueva hoja de ruta de la organización han participado un total de 30.883 personas. Un 86,59% han votado a favor del texto, es decir, 26.741 inscritos; en la consulta que la dirección del partido realizó en junio para que la militancia delegara la decisión sobre la coalición con Sumar en la cúpula dirigida por Belarra participaron 52.000 personas.
La intención de este documento es adaptar la estrategia de Podemos a la situación actual para dar carpetazo al mandato de la última Asamblea Ciudadana, donde los inscritos mandataron impulsar el liderazgo de Yolanda Díaz en el espacio de la izquierda alternativa. El giro se produce en base a una propuesta de la dirección y con el refrendo y las aportaciones de la militancia, pero sin celebrar una asamblea, que es el procedimiento habitual para elegir la hoja de ruta y a la cúpula de la organización.
La prohibición de la doble militancia en los comuns
En el último mes, la propuesta de la dirección ha recibido numerosas aportaciones de los círculos y de otras entidades territoriales y militantes del partido. En líneas generales el texto establece la autonomía y la diferenciación de Podemos en el espacio de la izquierda alternativa y fija las reglas tanto de futuras alianzas con otros partidos como en la votación de una eventual investidura.

3,Consignas franquistas y gritos de “Sánchez a prisión” frente a la sede del PSOE en Madrid,"Los manifestantes concentrados en Ferraz protestaban contra los acuerdos del PSOE con ERC
Varios cientos de personas convocadas a través de las redes sociales se han concentrado este viernes contra la ley de amnistía y el Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez y han pedido “unidad nacional” en las proximidades de la sede del PSOE de la calle Ferraz, en Madrid, después de que la policía les impidiera concentrarse justo frente a las puertas de las oficinas del partido.
Con el lema “No a la amnistía”, los manifestantes han mostrado su rechazo al pacto alcanzado por el PSOE con ERC y especialmente contra una posible amnistía al expresidente de la Generalitat, Carles Puigdemont, en Bélgica desde el referéndum ilegal en Catalunya de 2017.
En varias ocasiones han gritado “Puigdemont a prisión” y en la cabecera de la manifestación había un cartel grande que decía “Pedro Sánchez a prisión”.
Sánchez y Puigdemont han sido contra quienes se han dirigido la mayor parte de los gritos durante la concentración.
La petición de unidad nacional ha sido la principal exigencia y se han escuchado cánticos como “España una, y no 51” o “No nos engañen, Catalunya es España”.
La pretensión de los manifestantes era situarse delante de la sede de Ferraz, si bien desde horas antes la Policía había acordonado la zona, por lo que la multitud ha tenido que situarse en unos números más abajo de la calle.
“Dejadnos pasar», han reclamado a la policía los participantes en la protesta, en la que se han ondeado banderas de España y alguna de Cataluña.","The protesters concentrated in Ferraz protested against the PSOE agreements with ERC several hundred people summoned through social networks have concentrated this Friday against the Amnesty Law and the Government of Pedro Sánchez and have requested “national unity” in the vicinityFrom the headquarters of the PSOE of Ferraz Street, in Madrid, after the police prevented them from concentrating right in front of the doors of the party offices.With the motto ""No to Amnesty"", the Protesters have shown their rejection of the pact achieved by the PSOE with ERC and especially against a possible amnesty to the former president of the Generalitat, Carles Puigdemont, in Belgium since the illegal referendum in Catalonia of 2017.

4,"Podemos e IU, en alerta por el reparto ministerial entre Pedro Sánchez y Yolanda Díaz","Ambas organizaciones consultarán a su militancia su apoyo a la investidura de Sánchez. Su inclusión en el Ejecutivo podría depender del número de carteras que pacten el PSOE y Sumar.
La falta de acuerdo entre el PSOE y Junts ha desacelerado una investidura de Pedro Sánchez que esta semana, por momentos, parecía inminente. Este viernes, estaba escrito que la presidenta del Congreso, la socialista Francina Armengol, convocaría el Pleno para mediados de la semana próxima. En cuestión de días, por tanto, un nuevo Gobierno de coalición tomaría posesión. Aunque Carles Puigdemont haya enfriado las prisas, esa posibilidad sigue encima de la mesa, y el revuelo en el seno del PSOE y de los partidos que conforman Sumar está garantizado por la expectación sobre quiénes asumirán las carteras ministeriales.
Por el momento, hay una variable que dificulta acertar en las quinielas: todavía no está asegurado el número de ministerios que conformarán el próximo Ejecutivo. Sánchez, según fuentes de Sumar, dice unos días un número más amplio que otros, cuando reduce el Gobierno. Ante esta situación, hay partidos de la coalición de izquierdas que ayer se veían sentados en el Consejo de Ministros y hoy se ven fuera.
Es el caso de IU, que este jueves celebraba una Coordinadora Federal. El órgano dirigido por Alberto Garzón debatió con tensión acerca de las posibilidades de entrar a formar parte del próximo Ejecutivo presidido por Sánchez si este resulta investido, de nuevo, presidente. Algunas fuentes presentes en la reunión aseguran que esta semana ven más difícil un ministerio para IU que en el pasado.
El entorno de Yolanda Díaz no oculta que la vicepresidenta en funciones ha defendido en algunas ocasiones la presencia de perfiles técnicos, expertos y profesionales en las carteras ministeriales, por encima de dirigentes de los partidos políticos. Pero en IU afean que suenan nombres para ocupar estos puestos en el Gobierno que, por el contrario, sí que forman parte de organizaciones. Es el caso de Mónica García, líder de Más Madrid, a la que algunos sitúan al frente a Sanidad; o de comuns, muchos dan por hecho que la confluencia catalana volverá a tener sillón en la coalición gubernamental.
En IU, tanto el entorno más cercano al coordinador federal Garzón, como el más próximo a la dirección del PCE, cuyo secretario general es el diputado Enrique Santiago, consideran justo tener representación en un ministerio. La formación se ha volcado con Sumar y con Díaz desde que cogió las riendas, y ya se quedaron fuera del reparto de portavocías en el grupo parlamentario del Congreso.
Un ministerio para Podemos
La formación liderada por Garzón ha convocado a la militancia a un referéndum interno. Las votaciones online finalizarán este sábado a las 22 horas, pero se podrá votar en urna en las sedes del partido durante la jornada del domingo. La pregunta pactada por la Coordinadora Federal de IU para la consulta es: “En base al acuerdo de gobierno acordado entre Sumar y PSOE ¿Estás de acuerdo con que IU participe en un Gobierno de coalición Sumar y PSOE?”. Los resultados de esta consulta se darán a conocer, en principio, el próximo lunes.
Otra variable que influye en el reparto de las carteras que corresponderán a Sumar es si Podemos contará o no con una de ellas. Aunque no ha trascendido demasiada información de las negociaciones entre Sánchez y Díaz, en principio la formación morada no parecía entrar en este reparto, sobre todo si se parte de la premisa de que la primera intención del PSOE era la de reducir el número de carteras respecto a la legislatura pasada.
Ahora hay dos claves que apuntan a un eventual vuelco en este escenario. La primera es que los de Belarra se encuentran inmersos en un proceso de rearme identitario y de emancipación de Sumar para tener las manos libres durante la legislatura. Algunas voces de la propia formación morada trasladan que su inclusión en el Gobierno anticiparía una legislatura más tranquila que si se quedaran fuera, un escenario este último en el que Podemos ya ha advertido de que sus votos “valdrían lo mismo que los de ERC o el PNV”.
La segunda clave reside en los cambios constantes sobre el volumen ministerial en la negociación. No es lo mismo que Díaz afronte un reparto en el seno de su espacio con cinco carteras en el bolsillo, a que lo haga con tres o cuatro. De las condiciones en las que salga la vicepresidenta de su negociación con el PSOE depende en buena medida el reparto dentro del espacio de la izquierda alternativa.
En el caso de Podemos, además, la cuestión no sólo reside en si finalmente lideran un departamento o no. Los de Belarra han especificado qué departamento quieren y cuál sería la persona designada para ello. Su objetivo es que Irene Montero y su equipo sigan al frente de Igualdad en esta legislatura y, de hecho, es una petición que no sólo le han trasladado a Díaz, sino también al propio Sánchez (junto con medidas programáticas que finalmente no fueron recogidas en el acuerdo rubricado entre el PSOE y Sumar).
Podemos también consultará a su militancia sobre el apoyo a la investidura de Sánchez
De momento, la formación morada no tiene constancia de ninguna propuesta oficial por parte de Sánchez o de Díaz para que ocupen una cartera, pero han insistido en varias ocasiones en que son los órganos del partido los que eligen qué cargos institucionales ocupan sus dirigentes. También Podemos consultará a su militancia sobre el eventual apoyo a la investidura de Pedro Sánchez, pero sin circunscribirlo al acuerdo de Gobierno rubricado entre PSOE y Sumar. Esta consulta se lanzará a los inscritos de Podemos cuando se conozca la fecha del debate de investidura.","Both organizations will consult their militancy their support for Sánchez's investiture.Its inclusion in the Executive could depend on the number of portfolios that agree on the PSOE and add.The lack of agreement between the PSOE and Junts has slowed a investiture of Pedro Sánchez that this week, at times, seemed imminent.This Friday, it was written that the president of Congress, the socialist Francina Armengol, would convene the plenary for the mid -next week.In a matter of days, by So much, a new coalition government would take possession.Although Carles Puigdemont has cooled the hurry, that possibility continues on the table, and the stir in the bosom of the PSOE and the parties that make up adding is guaranteed by the expectation about who will assume the ministerial portfolios.At the moment, there is a variable that makes it difficult to succeed in the pools: the number of ministries that will make up the next executive is not yet insured.Sánchez, according to adding sources, A broader number says a few days than others, when it reduces the government.Given this situation, there are parties of the left -wing coalition that yesterday were seated in the Council of Ministers and today they look out.This is the case of IU, which this Thursday celebrated a federal coordinator.The body led by Alberto Garzón debated with tension about the possibilities of becoming part of the next executive chaired by Sánchez if it is invested, again, president.Some Sources present at the meeting ensure that this week they see more difficult a ministry for IU than in the past.The environment of Yolanda Díaz does not hide that the acting vice president has sometimes defended the presence of technical profiles, experts and professionals in the ministerial portfolios, above the leaders of the political parties.But in Iu AFEAN that names sound to occupy these positions in the government that, on the contrary, are part of organizations.

Their inclusion in the Executive could depend on the number of portfolios that the PSOE and Sumar agree on.
The lack of agreement between the PSOE and Junts has slowed down an investiture of Pedro Sánchez that this week, at times, seemed imminent. This Friday, it was written that the president of the Congress, socialist Francina Armengol, would convene the plenary session in the middle of next week. In a matter of days, therefore, a new coalition Government would take office. Although Carles Puigdemont has cooled the rush, that possibility remains on the table, and the stir within the PSOE and the parties that make up Sumar is guaranteed by expectation about who will assume the ministerial portfolios.
At the moment, there is a variable that makes it difficult to hit the quinielas: the number of ministries that will make up the next executive is not yet assured. Sánchez, according to Sumar sources, says a few days a larger number than others, when he reduces the government. In the face of this situation, there are parties of the coalition of leftists who yesterday were sitting in the Council of Ministers and today are seen outside.
This is the case with IU, which was held this Thursday by a Federal Coordinator. The body led by Alberto Garzón debated with tension about the possibilities of joining the next executive headed by Sánchez if he is invested, again, president. Some sources present at the meeting say that this week they see a ministry for UI more difficult than in the past.
The environment of Yolanda Díaz does not hide that the acting vice president has sometimes defended the presence of technical profiles, experts and professionals in ministerial portfolios, over leaders of political parties. But in IU they say that there are names to occupy these positions in the government that, on the contrary, are part of organizations. This is the case of Mónica García, leader of Más Madrid, whom some place at the head of Health; or of commons, many assume that the Catalan confluence will again have an armchair in the government coalition.
In IU, both the closest environment to the federal coordinator Garzón, and the closest to the leadership of the PCE, whose general secretary is the deputy Enrique Santiago, consider it fair to have representation in a ministry. The formation has turned to Sumar and Diaz since he took the reins, and they are already out of the distribution of spokespersons in the congressional parliamentary group.
A Ministry for Podemos
The formation led by Garzón has called the militancy for an internal referendum. Votes online will end this Saturday at 22 hours, but you can vote in urn at the party headquarters during Sunday's day. The question agreed by the UI Federal Coordinator for the consultation is: “On the basis of the government agreement reached between Sumar and PSOE Do you agree that IU will participate in an Sumar and PSOE coalition government?” The results of this consultation will be released in principle next Monday.
Another variable that influences the distribution of the portfolios that will correspond to Sumar is whether or not we can count on one of them. Although it has not transcended too much information from the negotiations between Sánchez and Díaz, in principle the purple formation did not seem to enter into this distribution, especially if it is based on the premise that the first intention of the PSOE was to reduce the number of portfolios compared to the last legislature.
Now there are two keys that point to a possible turnaround in this scenario. The first is that those of Belarra are immersed in a process of re-arming identity and emancipation of Sumar to have their hands free during the legislature. Some voices of the purple formation itself convey that their inclusion in the government would anticipate a quieter legislature than if they stayed out, a scenario the latter in which Podemos has already warned that their votes “would be the same as those of ERC or the PNV.”
The second key lies in the constant changes in the ministerial volume of negotiations. It's not the same thing that Diaz faces a cast in the middle of his space with five wallets in his pocket, to do it with three or four. On the conditions in which the vice president leaves her negotiation with the PSOE depends to a large extent on the distribution within the space of the alternative left.
In the case of Podemos, moreover, the question is not only whether they finally lead a department or not. Belarra's have specified which department they want and which person would be designated for it. Her goal is for Irene Montero and her team to remain at the head of Equality in this legislature and, in fact, it is a petition that has not only been transferred to Díaz, but also to Sanchez himself (along with programmatic measures that were not finally included in the initialled agreement between the PSOE and Sumar).
We can also consult his militancy about support for the investiture of Sánchez
At the moment, the purple formation has no official proposal on the part of Sánchez or Díaz to hold a portfolio, but they have insisted on several occasions that it is the organs of the party that choose which institutional positions their leaders occupy. We will also consult his militancy about the possible support for the investiture of Pedro Sánchez, but without limiting it to the initialled government agreement between PSOE and Sumar. This consultation will be launched to the registered members of Podemos when the date of the investiture debate is known.","Both organizations will consult their militancy on their support for Sánchez’s investment. Its inclusion in the Executive could depend on the number of portfolios that the PSOE and Sumar agree.
The lack of agreement between the PSOE and Junts has slowed down an investment of Pedro Sánchez that this week, for moments, seemed imminent. On Friday, it was written that the president of Congress, Socialist Francina Armengol, would convene the Plenary for mid-week next. In a matter of days, therefore, a new coalition government would take office. Although Carles Puigdemont has cooled the pressures, that possibility remains on the table, and the riot within the PSOE and the parties that make up Sumar is guaranteed by the expectation of who will take over the ministerial portfolios.
At the moment, there is a variable that makes it difficult to hit the quinielles: the number of ministries that will form the next Executive is still not ensured. Sánchez, according to Sumar sources, says a few days a broader number than others, when the Government reduces. In the face of this situation, there are parties of the left-wing coalition that yesterday were sitting in the Council of Ministers and today are outside.
It is the case of IU, which this Thursday celebrated a Federal Coordinator. The body led by Alberto Garzón has debated with tension about the possibilities of entering into the next Executive chaired by Sánchez if he is invested, again, president. Some sources at the meeting assure that this week they see a ministry more difficult for IU than in the past.
The environment of Yolanda Díaz does not hide that the vice-president in functions has defended in some occasions the presence of technical profiles, experts and professionals in ministerial portfolios, above the leaders of political parties. But in IU they say that they sound names to occupy these positions in the Government that, on the contrary, are part of organizations. It is the case of Mónica García, leader of Más Madrid, to which some place at the head of Sanidad; or of common, many give for granted that the Catalan confluence will again have a chair in the government coalition.
In IU, both the surrounding closest to the federal coordinator Garzón, as well as the closest to the direction of the PCE, whose general secretary is Deputy Enrique Santiago, consider it just to have representation in a ministry. The formation has been overwhelmed with Sumar and Díaz since he took the reins, and they have already stayed out of the distribution of spokesmen in the parliamentary group of Congress.
A ministry for us
The formation led by Garzón has called for the militance to hold an internal referendum. The online voting will be held on Saturday at 10 p.m., but voting will be possible in the party headquarters on Sunday. The question asked by the Federal Coordinator of IU for the consultation is: “On the basis of the government agreement agreed between Sumar and PSOE Do you agree that IU participate in a government of coalition Sumar and PSOE?”. The results of this consultation will be announced, in principle, next Monday.
Another variable that influences the distribution of the portfolios that will correspond to Sumar is whether or not Podemos will have one of them. Although it has not transcended too much information from the negotiations between Sánchez and Díaz, in principle the Morada formation did not seem to enter this division, especially if it comes from the premise that the first intention of the PSOE was to reduce the number of portfolios with respect to the previous legislature.
Now there are two keys that point to an eventual twist in this scenario. The first is that Belarra are immersed in a process of identity rearmament and emancipation of Sumar to have free hands during the legislature. Some voices from the Morada formation themselves say that their inclusion in the Government would anticipate a quieter legislature than if they were left, a scenario this latter in which Podemos has already warned that their votes “would be the same as those of ERC or the PNV”.
The second key lies in the constant changes on the ministerial volume in the negotiation. It’s not the same thing that Díaz faces a split in his space with five portfolios in his pocket, that he does it with three or four. From the conditions in which the vice-president comes out of his negotiation with the PSOE depends to a great extent the distribution within the space of the alternative left.
In the case of Podemos, in addition, the question is not only whether they finally lead a department or not.

Es la presidenta de la Cámara Baja, Francina Armengol, la encargada de fijarla y su equipo ha sido claro desde el primer día. “Vamos a hacer lo que esté en nuestra mano para facilitar la investidura a los candidatos”. Lo prometían ya en tiempos de la investidura de Alberto Núñez Feijóo. “Lo hicimos con el popular y lo estamos haciendo ahora con Pedro Sánchez”, zanjan, este viernes, en conversación con Público.
Así las cosas, hasta que Sánchez no cierre todos los acuerdos necesarios y se los traslade a Armengol, la presidenta no fijará la fecha de investidura. Hoy por hoy, con el acuerdo con Esquerra Republicana ya cerrado, es Junts per Catalunya, la fuerza política que lidera Carles Puigdemont desde Bruselas, el gran escollo que tiene que salvar Pedro Sánchez. Sin los siete votos de Junts, todo el resto de acuerdos quedarían reducidos a la irrelevancia.
El paso de las horas y las noticias de Bélgica han ido diluyendo las previsiones de que PSOE y Junts pudieran alcanzar un acuerdo durante la jornada de este viernes; algo que habría activado la posibilidad de que Armengol anunciara, a continuación, una fecha para la investidura. Nada más lejos de la realidad. Según ha trascendido, las discrepancias entre los dos equipos de negociación acerca del perímetro de la amnistía —es decir, hasta dónde abarca— mantienen el acuerdo encallado.
Ya por la mañana, Jordi Turull, secretario general de Junts, ha quebrado cualquier expectativa de entendimiento temprano. Así se ha expresado en una nota a la dirección de su partido, según adelantó La Vanguardia. “Vienen horas y días de mucha tensión”. Horas y días. Ha venido a completar, de alguna forma, las palabras que posteó Carles Puigdemont, el jueves por la tarde, en la red social X: “No cambiaremos la prudencia y las precauciones que hemos mantenido hasta ahora por más prisas que algunos tengan”.
Se espera, por tanto, que las negociaciones se alarguen, al menos, durante el fin de semana. Es un clima —muy espeso e, incluso, receloso— que contrasta con la sintonía de la que, aparentemente, han gozado los socialistas con Esquerra Republicana. En el acuerdo que hicieron público el 2 de noviembre, los independentistas liderados por Oriol Junqueras se comprometían a apoyar la investidura de Pedro Sánchez a cambio de la ley de amnistía, la cesión de Rodalies y la condonación de 15.000 millones de euros de la deuda catalana.
Es un punto, ese último, que ha despertado las más feroces críticas por parte del Partido Popular y que ha copado gran parte del debate de la jornada, incluso por encima de la amnistía.
Por su parte, también el Bloque Nacionalista Galego (BNG) ha encaminado su acuerdo con el PSOE. Tal y como ha adelantado Público a media mañana, los nacionalistas gallegos han pactado con los socialistas que el PSOE se comprometa a aliviar también la deuda de Galicia. En su caso, no a través de la condonación total o parcial que acordaron los socialistas con ERC para las comunidades que se acogieron al Fondo de Liquidez Autonómica (FLA), sino a través de “medidas de compensación análogas”, según reza el principio de acuerdo.
Sin restricciones para la fecha de investidura
Las fuerzas vascas, por el momento, guardan silencio. EH Bildu, desde el minuto uno, expresó su voluntad de facilitar la investidura de Sánchez, pero todavía no ha trascendido ningún acuerdo. Algo más tibio parece el PNV. En cualquier caso, todos los partidos saben que esta negociación, en la que Sánchez necesita los votos para su investidura, es el momento en el que más pueden apretar y del que más frutos pueden recoger.
Fuentes parlamentarias socialistas recuerdan que la presidenta del Congreso tiene la potestad de fijar la fecha de investidura cuando quiera, “sin necesidad de que pase por la Mesa de la Cámara ni por la Junta de Portavoces”. Con lo cual, Armengol no tendría restricciones, en ese sentido, para convocar el debate. Por otra parte, la Mesa ha acordado, este viernes, habilitar todos los días festivos (desde ahora, hasta el 27 de noviembre, el último día que tiene Sánchez para ser investido) para que se lleven a cabo plenos. También, por supuesto, el jueves día 9 de noviembre, festivo local en la ciudad de Madrid.
Las cábalas, por tanto, están servidas. En cualquier caso, fuentes de la presidencia del Congreso confirman a Público que, por deferencia con los diputados, se convocará una breve Junta de Portavoces antes del eventual pleno de investidura.","The decision on the investiture date is still in stand by.She is the president of the lower house, Francina Armengol, in charge of setting her and her team has been clear from day one.""We are going to do what is in our hand to facilitate the investiture to the candidates.""They already promised it in times of the investiture of Alberto Núñez Feijóo.""We did it with the popular and we are doing it now with Pedro Sánchez,"" Zanjan, this Friday, in conversation with public.So things, until Sanchez does not close all the necessary agreements and transfer them to Armengol, the president will not set the investiture date.Today, with the agreement with Esquerra Republicana already closed, it is Junts per Catalunya, the political force led by Carles Puigdemont from Brussels, the great obstacle that Pedro Sánchez has to save.Without the seven vows of Junts, all other agreements would be reduced to irrelevance.The passage of the hours and the news of Belgium have been diluting the forecasts that PSOE and Junts could reach an agreement during the day of this Friday;Something that would have activated the possibility of Armengol to announce, then a date for the investiture.Nothing is further from reality.As it has transcended, the discrepancies between the two negotiation teams about the perimeter of the amnesty - that is, how far they cover - keep the agreement encaled.Already in the morning, Jordi Turull, general secretary of Junts, has broken any Early understanding expectation.This has been expressed in a note to the direction of his party, according to La Vanguardia.""They come hours and days of great tension.""Hours and days.He has come to complete, in some way, the words posted by Carles Puigdemont, on Thursday afternoon, in the social network X: ""We will not change the prudence and precautions that we have maintained so far for more hurry than some have.""It is expected, therefore, that negotiations are extended, at least, during the weekend.It is a climate - very thick and even suspicious - that contrasts with the harmony of which, apparently, the socialists with Esquerra Republicana have enjoyed.In the agreement they made public on November 2, the independentistas led by Oriol Junqueras promised to support the investiture of Pedro Sánchez in exchange for the Amnesty Law, the assignment of Rodalies and the forgation of 15,000 million euros of the Catalan debt.It is a point, that last one, which has The most fierce criticisms from the Popular Party and that has taken much of the debate of the day, even above the amnesty.For its part, also the Galego nationalist bloc (BNG) has directed its agreement with the PSOE.As Public has advanced in the middle of the morning, Galician nationalists have agreed with the socialists that the PSOE undertakes to also relieve the debt of Galicia.Where appropriate, not through the total or partial condonation agreed Socialists with ERC for communities that accepted the Autonomous Liquidity Fund (Fla), but through “similar compensation measures,” according to the principle of agreement.Without restrictions for the investiture date, Basque forces, for the moment, are silent.EH Bildu, from minute one, expressed his willingness to facilitate Sánchez's investiture, but has not yet transcended any agreement.Something more warm looks like the PNV.In any case, all matches know That this negotiation, in which Sanchez needs the votes for his investiture, is the time when they can tighten the most and the most fruits can collect.Socialist parliamentary sources remember that the president of the Congress has the power to set the investiture date whenever she wants, ""without the need to pass through the Chamber table or by the Board of Spokespersons.""With which, Armengol would not have restrictions, in that sense, to convene the debate.On the other hand, the table He has agreed, this Friday, enable every holiday (from now on, until November 27, the last day Sánchez has to be invested) so that they take place full.Also, of course, on Thursday, November 9, local festive in the city of Madrid.Cabalas, therefore, are served.In any case, sources from the Presidency of Congress confirm public that, by deference with the deputies, a brief Board of Spokespersons will be convened before the eventual full of investiture.","The decision on the investiture date remains at stand by. She is the president of the Lower House, Francina Armengol, who is in charge of fixing it and her team has been clear from day one. “We will do what we can to facilitate the investiture of the candidates.” It was already promised at the time of the investiture of Alberto Núñez Feijóo. “We did it with the popular and we are doing it now with Pedro Sánchez,” they decide, this Friday, in conversation with Public.
So, until Sanchez closes all the necessary agreements and transfers them to Armengol, the president will not set the investiture date. Today, with the agreement with Esquerra Republicana already closed, is Junts per Catalunya, the political force that Carles Puigdemont leads from Brussels, the great stumbling block that Pedro Sanchez has to save. Without Junts' seven votes, all other agreements would be reduced to irrelevance.
The passing of the hours and the news from Belgium have diluted the forecasts that PSOE and Junts could reach an agreement during this Friday's day; something that would have activated the possibility that Armengol would then announce a date for the investiture. Nothing further from reality. As it has transcended, the disagreements between the two negotiating teams over the perimeter of the amnesty — that is, as far as it extends — keep the agreement blocked.
Already in the morning, Jordi Turull, general secretary of Junts, has broken any expectation of early understanding. This has been expressed in a note to the leadership of his party, according to La Vanguardia. “Times and days of great tension are coming.” Hours and days. He has come to complete, in some way, the words posted by Carles Puigdemont, on Thursday afternoon, on social network X: “We will not change the prudence and precautions we have maintained so far in more haste than some have.”
It is therefore expected that the negotiations will be extended at least over the weekend. It is a climate — very thick and even suspicious — that contrasts with the harmony that socialists have apparently enjoyed with Esquerra Republicana. In the agreement they made public on November 2, the independenceists led by Oriol Junqueras pledged to support the investiture of Pedro Sánchez in exchange for the amnesty law, the cession of Rodalies and the cancellation of 15 billion euros of the Catalan debt.
It is a point, that last one, that has aroused the fiercest criticisms on the part of the People's Party and that has taken a large part of the debate of the day, even above the amnesty.
For its part, the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG) has also entered into an agreement with the PSOE. As public has anticipated in the middle of the morning, the Galician nationalists have agreed with the socialists that the PSOE will also commit itself to alleviating Galicia's debt. In his case, not through the total or partial remission that the Socialists agreed with ERC for the communities that took over the Autonomous Liquidity Fund (FLA), but through “similar compensation measures”, according to the principle of agreement.
No restrictions on the date of investiture
The Basque forces, for the moment, remain silent. EH Bildu, from minute one, expressed his willingness to facilitate the investiture of Sánchez, but has not yet transcended any agreement. Something warmer looks like the VNP. In any case, all the parties know that this negotiation, in which Sánchez needs the votes for his investiture, is the moment when they can squeeze the most and the most fruits they can collect.
Socialist parliamentary sources recall that the president of Congress has the power to set the investiture date whenever she wants, “without having to go through the House Bureau or the Spokespersons’ Board.” With this in mind, Armengol would have no restrictions on convening the debate. On the other hand, the Bureau has agreed, this Friday, to enable all public holidays (from now until November 27, the last day Sanchez has to be invested) to be held full. Also, of course, on Thursday, November 9, a local holiday in the city of Madrid.
The cabals, therefore, are served. In any case, sources of the presidency of the Congress confirm to the Public that, by deference with the deputies, a brief Meeting of Spokespersons will be convened before the eventual investiture plenary.","The decision on the date of the investment is still in stand by. It is the president of the lower house, Francina Armengol, who is in charge of fixing it and her team has been clear from the first day. “We will do everything in our hands to facilitate the investment of candidates.” This was promised in the time of Alberto Núñez Feijóo’s investment. “We did it with the popular and we are doing it now with Pedro Sánchez,” they said, on Friday, in a conversation with Público.
So things, until Sánchez does not close all the necessary agreements and transfer them to Armengol, the president will not fix the date of investorship. Today, with the agreement with Esquerra Republicana already closed, it is Junts per Catalunya, the political force that leads Carles Puigdemont from Brussels, the great scourge that has to save Pedro Sánchez. Without the seven votes of Junts, all the other agreements would be reduced to irrelevance.
The passing of the hours and news from Belgium have diluted the forecasts that PSOE and Junts could reach an agreement during the day on Friday; something that would have activated the possibility that Armengol would then announce a date for the investment. Nothing further from reality. According to him, the discrepancies between the two negotiating teams about the perimeter of the amnesty — that is, to what extent it encompasses — keep the agreement stuck.

This was stated in a note to the leadership of his party, according to La Vanguardia. “There are hours and days of great tension.” hours and days. He came to complete, in some way, the words that Carles Puigdemont posted on Thursday afternoon on the social network X: “We will not change the prudence and precautions that we haveined until now for more pressures that some have.”
Negotiations are expected to be extended at least over the weekend. It is a climate — very thick and even reckless — that contrasts with the sintony that apparently socialists have with the Republican Left. In the agreement they made public on November 2, the independentists led by Oriol Junqueras were committed to supporting Pedro Sánchez’s investment in exchange for the amnesty law, the transfer of Rodalies and the condonation of 15 billion euros of Catalan debt.
It is a point, the latter, that has awakened the most fierce criticisms on the part of the Popular Party and that has copied much of the debate of the day, even above the amnesty.
The Gallego Nationalist Bloc (BNG) has also signed an agreement with the PSOE. As it has advanced Public at midnight, the Galician nationalists have agreed with the socialists that the PSOE undertakes to relieve the debt of Galicia as well. If so, not through the total or partial condemnation that the socialists agreed with ERC for the communities that were welcomed to the Autonomous Liquidity Fund (FLA), but through “analogue compensation measures”, according to the agreement principle.
No restrictions on the date of investment
For the time being, the Basque forces remain silent. EH Bildu, from the first minute, expressed his will to facilitate Sánchez’s investment, but has yet to transcend any agreement. Somewhat quieter looks like the PNV.

6,"La figura del verificador entre el PSOE y ERC, un primer paso hacia la supervisión de las negociaciones del conflicto catalán","Los socialistas aceptan que una entidad internacional supervise sus conversaciones con los republicanos, aunque rechazan que forme parte de la Mesa de Diálogo entre gobiernos.
La figura del mediador es una figura que sobrevuela habitualmente la mayoría de los numerosos conflictos políticos, con o sin violencia, que se producen hasta en el último rincón del planeta. Se plantea como pieza clave para la resolución de conflictos, y es una figura habitualmente codiciada por la parte más débil y rechazada por la parte fuerte. El débil lo considera un refuerzo a sus planteamientos y el fuerte un obstáculo para sus imposiciones.
También es habitualmente una figura que permite a una parte intentar internacionalizar el conflicto, mientras la otra acostumbra a querer evitarlo. En el caso de los Estados, alegando que se trata de un asunto interno en el que no se debe inmiscuir ningún actor exterior.
Este planteamiento encajaría también en el conflicto político entre Catalunya y el Estado español, que desembocó en el referéndum y la declaración de independencia del 2017, con graves consecuencias judiciales posteriores. Y, por ello, el independentismo catalán clama desde hace años exigiendo esta figura del mediador, mientras que el Gobierno español la rechaza, apelando a esa consideración de asunto interno, a pesar de haber reconocido la existencia de un conflicto político.
Pero el acuerdo de investidura entre el PSOE y ERC parece haber movido un poco las posiciones y, aunque no se puede hablar de mediadores, sí ha conseguido colarse la figura del verificador. Quizás como primer paso en la supervisión de las negociaciones para la resolución del conflicto catalán.
Espacio de negociación y verificador
El acuerdo establecido entre el PSOE y ERC para la investidura de Pedro Sánchez dice, literalmente, que paralelamente a la Mesa de Diálogo y Negociación entre gobiernos que continuará los trabajos de la legislatura pasada, “se creará un espacio de negociación entre ambos partidos que cuente con un mecanismo que tenga las funciones de acompañar, verificar y realizar seguimiento de todo el proceso de negociación y de los acuerdos a los que se llegue”.
Fuentes de la negociación explican a Público que este verificador se circunscribe exclusivamente a las conversaciones entre el PSOE y ERC, en un comité de relaciones entre socialistas y republicanos, en las que participarán miembros de los dos partidos. En ningún caso la verificación se producirá en la Mesa de Diálogo, en la que se sentarán exclusivamente miembros de ambos ejecutivos sin participación externa alguna.
El PSOE acepta dos propuestas de verificadores de ERC
Según fuentes de Esquerra durante una conversación informal con un grupo de periodistas —entre los que se encontraba Público—, el PSOE habría aceptado ya dos de las propuestas de la media docena de entidades u organizaciones internacionales especializadas en resolución de conflictos que han aportado por los republicanos. Aunque se reservan dar nombres a la espera de que alguna de estas dos organizaciones acepte el encargo o lo declinen.
El paso para activar este mecanismo de verificación deberá darlo ahora el PSOE, con un contacto para demandar estos servicios con la organización finalmente elegida, ya que el protocolo de estos casos requiere se active el proceso de verificación a instancias de las dos partes.
Estamos, pues, lejos de poder hablar de mediadores —y mucho menos en la esfera institucional— entre el Gobierno español y el de la Generalitat. Y los expertos en resolución de conflictos consultados apuntan que la fórmula de supervisar las conversaciones entre los dos partidos —pero no la Mesa de Diálogo— “no es lo más óptimo, pero si las partes lo aceptan, se puede realizar”.
Estos expertos alertan también de la dificultad que implica que las negociaciones se den por separado entre el PSOE, ERC y Junts, aunque estos últimos también dispongan de alguna figura similar. De hecho, este sería un punto a pulir entre Junts y el PSOE, que mantiene encallado a última hora el acuerdo de investidura. Ahora bien, los expertos ven con normalidad estas dificultades, ya que aseguran que la fragmentación de actores en las partes enfrentadas, especialmente en la más débil, es un fenómeno muy habitual.
Los efectos en la Mesa de Diálogo
Los efectos en la Mesa de Diálogo
Pero esta verificación que ha aceptado el PSOE no es menor, dado que el acuerdo de investidura también establece que ese “espacio de negociación” o “comité de relaciones” entre los dos partidos tiene “la finalidad de que las propuestas que lleguen a la Mesa de Diálogo, Negociación y Acuerdo cuenten con un ritmo de trabajo constante y con un grado óptimos de debate y compromiso político y puedan implementarse durante la presente legislatura”.
Y, aunque los trabajos finales en esa Mesa de Diálogo entre gobiernos y sus acuerdos no contarán con la verificación, la supervisión previa de un tercero “puede ayudar a evitar malentendidos, disonancias, interpretaciones divergentes o erróneas y facilitar los trabajos y, por consiguiente, los acuerdos”, aseguran fuentes de la negociación.
El acuerdo fija que “a tal fin, se designará de mutuo acuerdo a una persona de reconocido prestigio para realizar dichas tareas”. Dirigentes de Esquerra han explicado en la conversación informal de este martes con un grupo de periodistas que no se trataría de una persona física como tal, sino más bien de una entidad de reconocido prestigio, que designaría a uno o diversos miembros de sus equipos de trabajo para realizar la verificación. Pero que, en cualquier caso, es la entidad u organización como tal quién respondería frente a una controversia o conflicto entre los dos partidos.
La ratificación y continuidad de la Mesa de Diálogo era una de las tres condiciones que exigía Esquerra para el acuerdo de investidura, junto a la amnistía y la carpeta social de la financiación, y el traspaso de Rodalies.
«Ahora deberemos centrarnos en la resolución del conflicto político por vías exclusivamente políticas y democráticas, y nosotros proponemos el referéndum de autodeterminación pactado», aseguran desde ERC.
En cambio, el PSOE rechaza la posibilidad de ese referéndum, y en el acuerdo solo figura que “también debe abordarse el debate sobre la forma en que los acuerdos a los que se puede llegar sobre el marco político de Catalunya puedan ser refrendados por el pueblo catalán”.
Las categorías de los expertos en resolución de conflictos
Las categorías de los expertos en resolución de conflictos
Los expertos en resolución de conflictos políticos alertan de que existe una gran confusión en las nomenclaturas, y que no es lo mismo un mediador que un relator o un verificador, entre muchas otras figuras y fórmulas que existen a la hora de intervenir en el intento de resolver un conflicto político.
La figura del de mediador sería el rango más alto, pero es muy poco frecuente, ya que es una figura que, en las negociaciones, se sitúa al mismo nivel que las partes. “Lo que pasa es que muchas veces se confunde lo que es un relator o verificador con el mediador”, asegura una experta “y sus funciones y estatus son radicalmente diferentes”.
En la resolución de conflictos, el mediador es la figura más intervencionista, y puede proponer a las partes la agenda a seguir o puntos del orden del día de las reuniones. También es alguien que propone una solución y que actúa como una tercera parte.
Otra figura sería el facilitador, que tiene entre sus funciones dinamizar las reuniones para que se desarrollen positivamente, incluso desde el punto de vista de la logística. También existe el relator, que actúa tomando notas. Y, finalmente, un verificador que sería quien se cerciora de que se cumple lo pactado. Esta sería la figura incluida en el acuerdo entre el PSOE y ERC.
Si el conflicto entre Catalunya y el estado realmente llega algún día a una negociación clásica de resolución de conflictos, antes de llegar al mediador, requerirá de figuras previas, pero no menos indispensables.
Entre ellas, el explorador, que mira las intenciones y disposiciones reales de las partes; el preparador, que habilita a alguna de las partes para que esté en condiciones de sentarse en una mesa de negociación; o el convocante, que invita solemnemente a las partes a sentarse para negociar. Y, posteriormente, otros actores como el incentivador (con propuestas económicas o políticas) o el unificador (que agrupa a las disidencias que puedan surgir).
En cualquiera de sus variantes, los expertos en resolución de conflictos tienen dos premisas: prudencia y confidencialidad respecto a las conversaciones, y discreción para pasar inadvertidos. Lo cual no quiere decir que no haya algunos muy conocidos, como George Mitchell en el caso irlandés o el obispo sudafricano Desmond Tutu.
En Europa existe una larga tradición de organizaciones ligadas a universidades o fundaciones dedicadas a estas labores. Por ejemplo, en Suiza o los países nórdicos, con Noruega a la cabeza. La Fundación Olof Palme sería un claro exponente.
El trabajo discreto de Rovira en Suiza
El trabajo discreto de Rovira en Suiza
En el caso del conflicto catalán, este primer paso de verificación internacional, ni se ha improvisado, ni sale de la nada. Tiene mucho que ver con la elección que hizo la secretaria general de Esquerra, Marta Rovira, del país para pasar su exilio. Eligió justamente en la ciudad suiza de Ginebra, un epicentro de este tipo de organizaciones.
Rovira se trasladó en 2018 a Suiza para evitar la cárcel que comportaba su imputación por rebelión, la cual hubiera derivado en sedición. Y, aunque el delito decayó con la reforma del Código Penal, se ha mantenido en territorio suizo, dado que ya se esperaba la imputación como presunta dirigente de Tsunami Democràtic, que se ha oficializado este viernes por parte de la Audiencia Nacional. Imputación que comporta una acusación de terrorismo, y que la amnistía pactada contempla después de una dura negociación.
Rovira ha realizado un exhaustivo trabajo en el ámbito de la resolución de conflictos y Esquerra ha contado con el asesoramiento de algunos destacados expertos para encarar la negociación con el Gobierno español estos últimos años.
Los republicanos catalanes, además, han contado con la experiencia de algunos de sus socios internacionales inmersos en conflictos, aunque de naturaleza violenta y por tanto muy diferente a la del catalán, que es estrictamente pacífico. Es el caso de la izquierda abertzale, con EH Bildu; o de Irlanda, con los dirigentes del Sinn Féin y con Gerry Adams al frente. A estos últimos visitó hace pocos días el presidente de Esquerra, Oriol Junqueras, y hace unos meses el president de la Generalitat, Pere Aragonès.
La dirección de Esquerra lo reconocía este martes sin ambages, aunque de manera informal a un grupo de periodistas. “No hemos llegado solos hasta aquí. Nos han acompañado y nos han asesorado algunas fundaciones de carácter internacional y algunos mediadores de conflictos. Y queríamos que esto quedara reflejado de alguna manera en este acuerdo de investidura”.
“De momento nace entre los dos partidos, el PSOE y ERC” admiten los republicanos, pero recuerdan que en el foro entre partidos también habrá miembros del Govern, que formarán parte de la Mesa de Diálogo, Negociación y Acuerdo, donde veremos si se cierra o no el anhelado pacto que resuelva el complejo conflicto político entre Catalunya y el Estado español.","Socialists accept that an international entity supervises their conversations with Republicans, although they reject that it is part of the dialogue table between governments.The figure of the mediator is a figure that usually flies over most of the numerous political conflicts, with or without violence, which occur even in the last corner of the planet.It is raised as a key piece for conflict resolution, and is a figure usually coveted by the weakest part and rejected by the strong part.The weak considers it a reinforcement to its approaches and the strong an obstacle to their impositions.It is also usually a figure that allows one part to try to internationalize the conflict, while the other usually wants to avoid it.In the case of states, claiming that it is an internal issue in which no exterior actor should be interference.This approach would also fit into the political conflict between Catalunya and the State Spanish, which led to the referendum and the declaration of independence of 2017, with serious subsequent judicial consequences.And, therefore, Catalan independence cries out for years demanding this mediator figure, while the Spanish government rejects it, appealing to that internal matter consideration, despite having recognized the existence of a political conflict.But the investiture agreement between the PSOE and ERC seems to have moved the positions a bit and, although not You can talk about mediators, the figure of the verifier has managed to sneak into.Perhaps as a first step in the supervision of negotiations for the resolution of the Catalan conflict.Negotiation and Verifier Space The agreement established between the PSOE and ERC for the investiture of Pedro Sánchez literally says that in parallel to the dialogue and negotiation table between governments that will continue the work of the last legislature, “a negotiation space will be createdBetween both parties that have a mechanism that has the functions of accompanying, verifying and monitoring the entire negotiation process and the agreements to which it is reached ”.Negotiation sources explain to the public that this verifier is limited exclusively to the conversations between the PSOE and ERC, in a committee of relations between socialists and Republicans, in which members of the two parties will participate.In no case will the verification occur at the table of Dialogue, in which members of both executives will be seated exclusively without any external participation.The PSOE accepts two proposals for ERC verifiers according to Scherra sources during an informal conversation with a group of journalists - among which he was public - the PSOE would have already accepted two of the proposals of the half dozen entities or specialized international organizationsin conflict resolution that have contributed by Republicans.Although They reserve names waiting for any of these two organizations to accept the commission or decline.The step to activate this verification mechanism must now give it the PSOE, with a contact to demand these services with the organization finally chosen, since the protocol of these cases requires the verification process at the request of the two parties is activated.We are, therefore, far from being able to talk about mediators - and much less in the institutional sphere - among the government Spanish and that of the Generalitat.And experts in conflict resolution consulted point out that the formula of supervising conversations between the two games - but not the dialogue table - ""is not the most optimal, but if the parties accept it, it can be done.""These experts also warn of the difficulty that the negotiations are given separately between the PSOE, ERC and Junts, although the latter also have a similar figure.In fact, this would be a point to polish Between Junts and the PSOE, which keeps the investiture agreement on the last minute.However, experts see these difficulties normally, since they ensure that the fragmentation of actors in the faced parts, especially in the weakest, is a very common phenomenon.The effects on the dialogue table The effects on the dialogue table but this verification that the PSOE has accepted is not less, given that the investiture agreement also establishes that this ""negotiation space"" or ""relationship committee"" between the two parties has ""the purpose that the proposals that reach the dialogue table, negotiation and agreement have a constant work pace and with an optimal degree of debate and political commitment and can be implemented duringthe present legislature ”.And, although the final works at that dialogue table between governments and their agreements will not have verification, the prior supervision of a third party ""can help avoid misunderstandings, Dissonances, divergent or erroneous interpretations and facilitate the work and, consequently, the agreements, ”says negotiation sources.The agreement sets that ""for this purpose, a person of recognized prestige will be designated as mutual to perform these tasks.""Esquerra leaders have explained in the informal conversation on Tuesday with a group of journalists who would not be a natural person as such, but rather an entity of recognized prestige, which It would designate one or diverse members of their work teams to perform the verification.But that, in any case, it is the entity or organization as such who would respond to a controversy or conflict between the two parties.The ratification and continuity of the dialogue table was one of the three conditions that Esquerra demanded for the investiture agreement, together with the amnesty and the social folder of financing, and the transfer of Rodalies.«Now we must focus on the Resolution of the political conflict by exclusively political and democratic roads, and we propose the agreed self -determination referendum, ”they say from ERC.On the other hand, the PSOE rejects the possibility of that referendum, and in the agreement only appears that “the debate must also be addressed on the way in which the agreements that can be reached on the political framework of Catalonia can be endorsed by the peopleCatalan"".The categories of experts in resolution of Conflicts The categories of conflict resolution experts Experts in political conflict resolution warn that there is great confusion in nomenclatures, and that a mediator is not the same as a rapporteur or verifier, among many other figures and formulas thatThey exist when intervening in the attempt to resolve a political conflict.The figure of the mediator would be the highest range, but it is very rare, since it is a figure that, in negotiations, It is located at the same level as the parties.""What happens is that many times it is confused what is a rapporteur or verifier with the mediator,"" says an expert ""and its functions and status are radically different.""In conflict resolution, the mediator is the most interventionist figure, and can propose to the parties the agenda to follow or points of the order of meetings.It is also someone who proposes a solution and acts as a third.Another figure would be the Facilitator, which has among its functions to energize meetings to develop positively, even from the point of view of logistics.There is also the rapporteur, which acts taking notes.And, finally, a verifier who would be the one who encloses that the agreed is fulfilled.This would be the figure included in the agreement between the PSOE and ERC.If the conflict between Catalunya and the State really arrives at a classical negotiation of conflict resolution, before arriving to the mediator, it will require previous figures, but not less indispensable.Among them, the explorer, who looks at the intentions and real provisions of the parties;the coach, who enables any of the parties to be able to sit at a negotiating table;or the convener, who solemnly invites the parties to sit down to negotiate.And, subsequently, other actors such as the incentive (with economic or political proposals) or the unifier (which groups the dissidents that may arise).In any of its variants, conflict resolution experts have two premises: prudence and confidentiality regarding conversations, and discretion to go unnoticed.Which does not mean that there are not some well -known, such as George

Switzerland or Nordic countries, with Norway to the head.The Olof Palme Foundation would be a clear exponent.Rovira's discreet work in Switzerland The discreet work of Rovira in Switzerland in the case of the Catalan conflict, this first step of international verification, has not been improvised, nor comes out of nowhere.It has a lot to do with the election made by the general secretary of Esquerra, Marta Rovira, of the country to pass her exile.Chose precisely in the Swiss city of Geneva, an epicenter of this type of organizations.Rovira moved in 2018 to Switzerland to avoid jail that behaved his imputation for rebellion, which would have resulted in sedition.And, although the crime declined with the reform of the Criminal Code, it has remained in Swiss territory, since the imputation was already expected as alleged leader of Tsunami Democràtic, which has been formalized this Friday by the National Court.Imputation that involves an accusation of terrorism, and that the agreed amnesty contemplate after a hard negotiation.Rovira has done an exhaustive work in the scope of conflict resolution and Esquerra has had the advice of some outstanding experts to face the negotiation with the Spanish government in recent years.The Catalan Republicans, in addition, have had the experience of some of their international partners immersed in conflicts, although of a violent nature and therefore very different from that of Catalan, which is strictly peaceful.This is the case of the Abertzale left, with EH Bildu;or of Ireland, with the leaders of Sinn Féin and with Gerry Adams in front.The latter visited the president of Esquerra, Oriol Junqueras a few days ago, and a few months ago the president of the Generalitat, Pere Aragonès.The Esquerra address recognized it on Tuesday without ambiguity, although informally to a group of journalists.“We have not reached alone.They have accompanied us and have advised some international foundations and some conflict mediators.And we wanted this to be reflected in some way in this investiture agreement. ”""At the moment it is born between the two games, the PSOE and ERC"" admit the Republicans, but remember that in the forum between matches there will also be members of the Government, who will be part of the dialogue, negotiation and agreement table, where we will see if it closesor not the desired pact that resolves the complex political conflict between Catalunya and the Spanish State.","Socialists accept that an international entity oversees their talks with Republicans, although they refuse to make it part of the Bureau of Inter-Government Dialogue.
The figure of the mediator is a figure that usually hovers over most of the numerous political conflicts, with or without violence, that occur even in the last corner of the planet. It poses itself as a key element for conflict resolution, and is a figure usually coveted by the weakest party and rejected by the strong party. The weak regards it as a reinforcement of their approaches and the strong one as an obstacle to their impositions.
It is also usually a figure that allows one party to try to internationalize the conflict, while the other tends to want to avoid it. In the case of States, on the grounds that this is an internal matter in which no outside actor should be involved.
This approach would also fit into the political conflict between Catalonia and the Spanish state, which led to the referendum and the declaration of independence in 2017, with serious subsequent judicial consequences. And for this reason, Catalan independence has been calling for this figure of the mediator for years, while the Spanish government rejects it, appealing to this consideration of the internal issue, despite having recognized the existence of a political conflict.
But the investiture agreement between the PSOE and ERC seems to have moved the positions a little bit and, although one cannot talk about mediators, the figure of the verifier has been able to slip in. Perhaps as a first step in monitoring the negotiations for the resolution of the Catalan conflict.
Trading space and verifier
The agreement between the PSOE and ERC for the investiture of Pedro Sánchez says, literally, that in parallel to the Bureau of Dialogue and Negotiation between governments that will continue the work of the last legislature, “a negotiating space will be created between the two parties that has a mechanism that has the functions of accompanying, verifying and monitoring the entire negotiation process and the agreements reached.”
Sources of the negotiation explain to Public that this verifier is limited exclusively to the talks between the PSOE and ERC, in a committee of relations between socialists and Republicans, in which members of the two parties will participate. Under no circumstances will the verification take place at the Dialogue Bureau, where members of both executives will sit exclusively without any external participation.
PSOE accepts two proposals from ERC verifiers
According to Esquerra sources during an informal conversation with a group of journalists, including the Public, the PSOE would have already accepted two of the proposals of half a dozen international entities or organizations specializing in conflict resolution that the Republicans have contributed. Although they reserve to give names waiting for either of these two organizations to accept the commission or to decline it.
The step to activate this verification mechanism must now be taken by the PSOE, with a contact to demand these services with the finally chosen organization, since the protocol of these cases requires the verification process to be activated at the request of the two parties.
We are, therefore, far from being able to talk about mediators — let alone institutionally — between the Spanish Government and that of the Generalitat. And the conflict resolution experts consulted point out that the formula of monitoring the talks between the two parties — but not the Dialogue Table — “is not the most optimal, but if the parties accept it, it can be carried out.”
These experts also warn of the difficulty of separate negotiations between the PSOE, ERC and Junts, although the latter also have a similar figure. In fact, this would be a point to polish between Junts and the PSOE, which keeps the investiture agreement stuck at the last minute. However, experts see these difficulties as normal, since they claim that the fragmentation of actors in the opposing parties, especially in the weakest parts, is a very common phenomenon.
The impact on the dialogue bureau
The impact on the dialogue bureau
But this verification accepted by the PSOE is not minor, since the investiture agreement also establishes that this “negotiation space” or “relationship committee” between the two parties has “the purpose of ensuring that the proposals that arrive at the Bureau of Dialogue, Negotiation and Agreement have a constant pace of work and an optimal degree of debate and political commitment and can be implemented during the current legislature.”
And, although the final work in that Bureau of Dialogue between Governments and their agreements will not be subject to verification, the prior supervision of a third party “may help to avoid misunderstandings, dissonances, divergent or erroneous interpretations and facilitate work and, consequently, agreements”, assure sources of negotiation.
The agreement provides that “to that end, a person of recognized standing shall be appointed by mutual agreement to perform such tasks”. Esquerra leaders have explained in this Tuesday's informal conversation with a group of journalists that it would not be a natural person as such, but rather an entity of recognized prestige, who would appoint one or several members of their work teams to perform the verification. But in any case, it is the entity or organization as such that would respond to a dispute or conflict between the two parties.
The ratification and continuity of the Bureau of Dialogue was one of the three conditions that Esquerra demanded for the investiture agreement, together with the amnesty and the social fund of the financing, and the transfer of Rodalies.
""We must now focus on resolving the political conflict through exclusively political and democratic means, and we propose the agreed referendum on self-determination,"" ERC says.
On the other hand, the PSOE rejects the possibility of such a referendum, and the agreement only states that “the debate must also be addressed on how the agreements that can be reached on the political framework of Catalonia can be endorsed by the Catalan people”.
The categories of conflict resolution experts
The categories of conflict resolution experts
Political conflict resolution experts warn that there is great confusion in the nomenclatures, and that it is not the same as a mediator as a rapporteur or verifier, among many other figures and formulas that exist when it comes to intervening in the attempt to resolve a political conflict.
The figure of the mediator would be the highest, but it is very rare, since it is a figure that, in the negotiations, stands at the same level as the parties. “What happens is that many times what is a rapporteur or verifier is confused with the mediator,” says an expert “and her functions and status are radically different.”
In conflict resolution, the mediator is the most interventionist figure, and can propose to the parties the agenda to follow or items on the agenda of meetings. He is also someone who proposes a solution and acts as a third party.
Another figure would be the facilitator, who has among his functions to dynamize the meetings to be conducted positively, including from the point of view of logistics. There is also the rapporteur, who acts by taking notes. And finally, a verifier who would be the one to make sure that the agreement is fulfilled. This would be the figure included in the agreement between the PSOE and ERC.
If the conflict between Catalonia and the state actually one day comes to a classical negotiation of conflict resolution, before reaching the mediator, it will require previous figures, but no less indispensable.
Among them, the scout, who looks at the actual intentions and arrangements of the parties; the preparer, who enables one of the parties to be able to sit at a negotiating table; or the convener, who solemnly invites the parties to sit down to negotiate. And, later, other actors such as the incentive (with economic or political proposals) or the unifier (which groups together the dissidences that may arise).
In any of its variants, conflict resolution experts have two premises: prudence and confidentiality regarding conversations, and discretion to go unnoticed. Which does not mean that there are not some well known, such as George Mitchell in the Irish case or South African Bishop Desmond Tutu.
In Europe there is a long tradition of organisations linked to universities or foundations dedicated to these tasks. For example, in Switzerland or the Nordic countries, with Norway leading the way. The Olof Palme Foundation would be a clear exponent.
Rovira's discreet work in Switzerland
Rovira's discreet work in Switzerland
In the case of the Catalan conflict, this first step of international verification has neither been improvised nor comes out of nowhere. It has a lot to do with the election made by Esquerra's secretary general, Marta Rovira, of the country to spend her exile. He chose in the Swiss city of Geneva, an epicenter of such organizations.
Rovira moved to Switzerland in 2018 to avoid the prison that entailed his charge of rebellion, which would have resulted in sedition. And, although the crime lapsed with the reform of the Penal Code, it has remained on Swiss territory, given that the alleged leader of Tsunami Democratic was already expected to be charged, which has been officialized on Friday by the National High Court. An accusation that involves an accusation of terrorism, and that the agreed amnesty contemplates after a hard negotiation.
Rovira has done extensive work in the area of conflict resolution and Esquerra has had the advice of some leading experts to address negotiations with the Spanish Government in recent years.
The Catalan Republicans, moreover, have had the experience of some of their international partners immersed in conflicts, although of a violent nature and therefore very different from that of Catalan, which is strictly peaceful. This is the case of the left abertzale, with EH Bildu; or Ireland, with the Sinn Féin leaders and Gerry Adams at the front. The latter was visited a few days ago by the president of Esquerra, Oriol Junqueras, and a few months ago by the president of the Generalitat, Pere Aragonès.
Esquerra's management recognized it this Tuesday without any consequences, although informally to a group of journalists. “We didn’t get here alone. We have been accompanied and advised by some international foundations and some conflict mediators. And we wanted this to be reflected in some way in this investiture agreement.”
“At the moment it is born between the two parties, the PSOE and ERC” admit the Republicans, but remember that in the forum between parties there will also be members of the Govern, who will be part of the Table of Dialogue, Negotiation and Agreement, where we will see whether or not the long-awaited pact that resolves the complex political conflict between Catalonia and the Spanish State is closed.","The Socialists accept that an international entity oversee their conversations with the Republicans, although they refuse to be part of the Intergovernmental Dialogue Table.
The mediator figure is a figure that usually overlooks most of the numerous political conflicts, with or without violence, that occur even in the last corner of the planet. He poses himself as a key piece for conflict resolution, and is a figure usually coveted by the weaker side and rejected by the strong side.

It is also usually a figure that allows one party to try to internationalize the conflict, while the other usually wants to avoid it. In the case of states, arguing that this is an internal matter in which no external actor should be involved.

But the investment agreement between the PSOE and ERC seems to have moved the positions a little and, although it is not possible to talk about mediators, it has managed to catch the figure of the verifier. Per as a first step in overseeing the negotiations for the resolution of the Catalan conflict.
Negotiation and Verifier
The agreement established between the PSOE and ERC for Pedro Sánchez’s investment says, literally, that in parallel to the Dialogue and Negotiation Table between governments that will continue the work of the past legislature, “a negotiation space will be created between both parties that has a mechanism that has the functions of accompanying, verifying and monitoring the entire process of negotiation and the agreements reached.”
Sources from the negotiations explained to Público that this verifier is exclusively circumscribed to the conversations between the PSOE and ERC, in a committee of relations between socialists and republicans, in which members of the two parties will participate. In no case shall the verification be carried out at the Dialogue Table, in which exclusively members of both executives shall sit without any external participation.
The PSOE accepts two proposals of ERC verificators
According to sources from Esquerra during an informal conversation with a group of journalists —among which was Público—, the PSOE would have accepted two of the proposals of the half dozen of international entities or organizations specialized in conflict resolution that have been provided by the Republicans. Although they reserve to give names waiting for any of these two organizations to accept the order or decline it.
The step to activate this verification mechanism must now be given by the PSOE, with a contact to demand these services with the finally chosen organization, since the protocol of these cases requires the activation of the verification process at the instances of both parties.
We are, then, far from being able to talk about mediators —and much less in the institutional sphere — between the Spanish Government and the Generalitat. And the experts in conflict resolution consulted point out that the formula of overseeing the conversations between the two parties – but not the Dialogue Table – “is not the most optimal, but if the parties accept it, it can be carried out.”

Now, experts see these difficulties normally, as they assure that the fragmentation of actors in the opposing parties, especially in the weakest, is a very common phenomenon.

But that, in any case, it is the entity or organization as such who would respond to a controversy or conflict between the two parties.
The ratification and continuity of the Dialogue Table was one of the three conditions Esquerra required for the investment agreement, along with amnesty and the social folder of funding, and the transfer of Neighbors.
“Now we must focus on resolving the political conflict exclusively by political and democratic means, and we propose the agreed referendum on self-determination,” they said.
Instead, the PSOE rejects the possibility of that referendum, and in the agreement only appears that “the debate should also be addressed on the way that the agreements that can be reached on the political framework of Catalonia can be approved by the Catalan people.”

7,Podemos abre una nueva etapa para desligarse política y estratégicamente de Sumar,"La militancia de la formación morada vota la nueva hoja de ruta del partido que, entre otros elementos, plantea su autonomía respecto a Yolanda Díaz
Podemos concluye este sábado el proceso de renovación de la hoja de ruta que seguirá el partido durante la próxima legislatura. En septiembre, los de Ione Belarra lanzaron un documento con una serie de bases que asentaban la estrategia de la organización y corregían el rumbo que tomó en su última Asamblea Ciudadana, en la que se designó a Belarra como secretaria general.
En ese cónclave, celebrado en 2021, se decidió apostar de manera decidida por que Yolanda Díaz asumiera el liderazgo del espacio de Unidas Podemos. Dos años después, la situación política ha cambiado mucho, las relaciones entre Belarra y Díaz, y entre Podemos y Sumar, no son las mismas, y la formación morada considera que es el momento de trazar una nueva senda que recoja el escenario actual.
El documento ha recibido numerosas aportaciones de la militancia en distintos niveles territoriales, y después de un proceso de debate abierto se somete ahora a votación de los inscritos (que decidirán si validan o no el texto entre el jueves y el viernes). Finalmente, este sábado Belarra presentará los resultados de la votación en una conferencia política que Podemos celebra en Madrid.
El documento fija las claves sobre las que se asentará la organización de cara a la próxima legislatura y, al menos, hasta que se celebre una asamblea ciudadana para renovar cargos y objetivos. Las principales claves son el rearme identitario y refuerzo de Podemos, la autonomía estratégica y política de los de Belarra frente a Sumar, y las nuevas reglas que el partido seguirá a la hora de trazar alianzas con otras formaciones.
“Es importante seguir trabajando para que Podemos mantenga su identidad diferenciadora dentro del bloque progresista. Una identidad que nos ha llevado a lograr cambios que parecían imposibles y que nos llevará a seguir impulsando las transformaciones mucho más lejos”, reza una de las aportaciones de la militancia aceptadas e incluidas en el documento final que se someterá a votación.
Autonomía y prohibición de la doble militancia
También respecto a su posición en este bloque, el texto recoge la “responsabilidad de proteger nuestra autonomía como fuerza política diferenciada y nuestra capacidad de tomar decisiones” y, prosigue el informe, “no debemos renunciar a alzar la voz ni a concretar un proyecto transformador y autónomo con capacidad para liderar sin doblegarse ni perder nuestra autonomía frente a otras formaciones”.
En este apartado de autonomía política se mantiene la redacción original que prohíbe la doble militancia a los inscritos de Podemos (por ejemplo, militar a la vez en Podemos y en Sumar) y se añade que esto no estará permitido “en ningún caso”. También se introduce como mandato la imposibilidad de “disolverse” en otros partidos o espacios.
“Podemos es una fuerza política autónoma con voz propia, que tendrá siempre su propia hoja de ruta, su programa, sus órganos de dirección y sus mecanismos de decisión protagonizados por la militancia y las y los inscritos. En ningún caso se disolverá en otro partido”, recoge el informe.
La autonomía y diferenciación respecto a Sumar también es estratégica. El documento de Podemos rechaza de manera tajante los discursos contrarios al “ruido” y a la “polarización” que han abanderado dirigentes como la propia vicepresidenta segunda del Gobierno, Yolanda Díaz.
“Frente a esos intereses políticos y altavoces mediáticos, nosotras reivindicamos el ruido, que significa no callar ante las injusticias y levantar la voz con el objetivo de lograr los avances que necesita nuestro país”; “la gente corriente siempre tiene poco que ganar en los despachos a puerta cerrada y mucho que ganar cuando los debates se abren a la calle. Sin ruido, un Gobierno de coalición es retroceso y asimilación de la fuerza más transformadora a la más conservadora”, defiende el documento de Podemos.
La “polarización” y el “ruido”
“La polarización se ha planteado como una equiparación entre cambio democrático y reacción antidemocrática, como una escala espuria en la que los dos extremos son por un lado la justicia social y por el otro el fascismo. Esa noción de polarización es falsa y enemiga de los avances democráticos. La polarización no es la relación entre el avance y la reacción, entre la justicia social y la defensa de privilegios. La verdadera polarización es la desigualdad”, se plantea en el documento.
Respecto a las alianzas con otras formaciones políticas, a los gobiernos de coalición y a los eventuales apoyos en investiduras también se establecen nuevas reglas en el seno del partido. “Para apoyar o formar parte de cualquier gobierno de coalición en el futuro debe incorporarse una parte sustancial del programa de Podemos”, añade una de las aportaciones al texto, en un momento en el que los de Belarra han defendido que Sumar negoció el acuerdo de coalición con el PSOE sin contar con ellos y sin incorporar sus reivindicaciones.
“En cualquier caso, los votos de los y las representantes de Podemos en las instituciones se deben negociar y nunca se regalan”, avisan en el texto, justo a las puertas de una eventual investidura de Pedro Sánchez. Sobre las relaciones en el espacio de la izquierda se recoge que “las alianzas con otras formaciones políticas se trabajarán y articularán con el objetivo de maximizar nuestra capacidad de cambio desde las instituciones y siempre desde el respeto mutuo a la autonomía de las distintas fuerzas políticas y con la celebración de primarias abiertas”.
Este sábado al mediodía se conocerá si la militancia del partido refrenda finalmente el documento que sienta las bases de un Podemos más autónomo, diferenciado y alejado del proyecto liderado por Yolanda Díaz.","The militancy of the purple formation votes the new roadmap of the party that, among other elements, raises its autonomy with respect to Yolanda Díaz we can conclude this Saturday the renewal process of the road map that will follow the party during the next legislature.In September, those of Ione Belarra launched a document with a series of bases that settled the organization's strategy and corrected the course that it took in their last citizen assembly, in which Belarra was appointed as general secretary.In that conclave, held in 2021, it was decided to bet in a determined way that Yolanda Díaz assumed the leadership of the United Space Podemos.Two years later, the political situation has changed a lot, the relations between Belarra and Díaz, and between Podemos and Add, are not the same, and the purple formation considers that it is time to draw a new path that collects the current scenario.The document has received numerous contributions from the militancy in different Territorial levels, and after an open debate process now undergoes the registered vote (which will decide whether or not they validate the text between Thursday and Friday).Finally, this Saturday Belarra will present the results of the vote at a political conference that we can celebrate in Madrid.The document sets the keys on which the organization will be based on the next legislature and, at least, until a citizen assembly is held to renew charges and goals.The main keys are the identity and reinforcement rearmament of Podemos, the strategic and political autonomy of those of Belarra against adding, and the new rules that the party will follow when drawing alliances with other formations.“It is important to continue working so that we can maintain its differentiating identity within the progressive block.An identity that has led us to achieve changes that seemed impossible and that will lead us to continue promoting transformations Much farther, ”says one of the contributions of the militancy accepted and included in the final document that will vote.Autonomy and prohibition of double militancy also with respect to its position in this block, the text includes the “responsibility to protect our autonomy as a differentiated political force and our ability to make decisions”, and, the report continues, “we must not give up raising thevoice or to specify a transformative and autonomous project with capacity to lead without bending or losing our autonomy against other formations. ”In this section of political autonomy, the original writing is maintained that prohibits the double militancy to the registrations of Podemos (for example, military at the same time in Podemos and in add) and it is added that this will not be allowed “in any case”.The impossibility of ""dissolving"" in other parties or spaces is also introduced as a mandate.""We can is an autonomous political force in your own voice, which will have Always its own road map, its program, its management bodies and its decision mechanisms starring the militancy and those registered.In no case will be dissolved in another party, ”the report collects.The autonomy and differentiation with respect to adding is also strategic.The document of Podemos sharply rejects the speeches contrary to the ""noise"" and the ""polarization"" that leaders have champion leaders such as the Second Vice President of the Government, Yolanda Díaz. ""Faced with those political interests and media speakers, we claim noise, which means not shut up in the face of injustices and raise your voice with the aim of achieving the progress that our country needs"";“Current people always have little to win in the offices behind closed doors and a lot to win when the debates open to the street.Without noise, a coalition government is setback and assimilation of the most transformative force to the most conservative ”, defends the Podemos Document.""Polarization"" and ""noise"" ""polarization has been raised as an equalization between democratic change and antidemocratic reaction, as a spurious scale in which the two extremes are on the one hand social justice and on the other fascism.That notion of polarization is false and enemy of democratic advances.Polarization is not the relationship between progress and reaction, between social justice and the defense of privileges.True polarization is Inequality, ”is raised in the document.Regarding alliances with other political formations, coalition governments and possible support in investiture also establish new rules within the party.""To support or be part of any coalition government in the future, a substantial part of the Podemos program must be incorporated,"" adds one of the contributions to the text, at a time when those of Belarra have defended that adding negotiated the agreement of the agreement of Coalition with the PSOE without counting them and without incorporating their claims.""In any case, the votes of the representatives of Podemos in the institutions must be negotiated and are never given,"" they warn in the text, just at the doors of an eventual investiture of Pedro Sánchez.On the relationships in the space on the left it is collected that “alliances with other political formations will be worked and articulated with the objective of maximizing our ability to change from institutions and always from mutual respect for the autonomy of the different political forces and with the celebration of open primaries ”.This Saturday at noon it will be known if the militancy of the party finally endorses the document that feels the foundations of a more autonomous, differentiated and away from the project led by Yolanda Díaz.","The militancy of the purple formation votes the new road map of the party that, among other elements, proposes its autonomy from Yolanda Díaz
We can conclude this Saturday the process of renewing the road map that the party will follow during the next legislature. In September, Ione Belarra's launched a document with a series of bases that established the organization's strategy and corrected the course it took at its last Citizens' Assembly, in which Belarra was designated as secretary general.
In that conclave, held in 2021, it was decided to bet decisively on Yolanda Díaz assuming the leadership of the United Podemos space. Two years later, the political situation has changed a lot, the relations between Belarra and Díaz, and between Podemos and Sumar, are not the same, and the purple formation considers that it is time to chart a new path that reflects the current scenario.
The document has received numerous contributions from the militancy at different territorial levels, and after an open debate process is now put to the vote of those registered (who will decide whether or not to validate the text between Thursday and Friday). Finally, this Saturday Belarra will present the results of the vote at a political conference that Podemos holds in Madrid.
The document sets out the keys on which the organization will settle for the next legislature and, at least, until a citizens' assembly is held to renew positions and objectives. The main keys are the re-arming and strengthening of Podemos, the strategic and political autonomy of those of Belarra against Sumar, and the new rules that the party will follow in drawing alliances with other formations.
“It is important to continue working so that We can maintain their differentiated identity within the progressive bloc. An identity that has led us to achieve changes that seemed impossible and that will lead us to continue driving the transformations much further”, says one of the contributions of the militancy accepted and included in the final document that will be put to the vote.
Autonomy and prohibition of double membership
Also with regard to its position in this block, the text reflects the “responsibility to protect our autonomy as a differentiated political force and our ability to make decisions” and, the report continues, “we must not give up raising our voice or realizing a transformative and autonomous project with the capacity to lead without bowing down or losing our autonomy to other formations.”
This section of political autonomy maintains the original wording that prohibits double membership of the registered members of Podemos (e.g. military at the same time in Podemos and Sumar) and adds that this will not be permitted “in any case”. It also introduces as a mandate the impossibility of “dissolve” in other parties or spaces.
“We can be an autonomous political force with its own voice, which will always have its own road map, its programme, its governing bodies and its decision-making mechanisms led by the militancy and those registered. In no case will it be dissolved in another party,” the report says.
Autonomy and differentiation from Sumar is also strategic. Podemos’s document categorically rejects the speeches against “noise” and “polarization” that have led leaders such as the government’s own second vice president, Yolanda Díaz.
“In the face of these political interests and media speakers, we claim the noise, which means not to shut up in the face of injustices and raise our voice in order to achieve the advances our country needs”; “the ordinary people always have little to gain in the offices behind closed doors and much to gain when the debates open to the streets. Without noise, a coalition government is retreat and assimilation of the most transformative force to the most conservative,” defends the Podemos document.
“Polarization” and “Noise”
“The polarization has been conceived as an equalization between democratic change and anti-democratic reaction, as a spurious scale in which the two extremes are on the one hand social justice and on the other hand fascism. That notion of polarization is false and enemy of democratic advances. Polarization is not the relationship between advancement and reaction, between social justice and the defense of privileges. The real polarization is inequality,” the document says.
With regard to alliances with other political formations, coalition governments and possible investiture support are also established new rules within the party. “To support or be part of any coalition government in the future, a substantial part of Podemos’ program must be incorporated,” adds one of the contributions to the text, at a time when Belarra’s have argued that Sumar negotiated the coalition agreement with the PSOE without counting on them and without incorporating their claims.
“In any case, the votes of the representatives of Podemos in the institutions must be negotiated and never given,” they warn in the text, just at the doors of a possible investiture of Pedro Sánchez. On relations in the space of the left, it is stated that “the alliances with other political formations will be worked and articulated with the objective of maximizing our capacity for change from the institutions and always from mutual respect to the autonomy of the different political forces and with the celebration of open primaries”.
This Saturday at noon will be known if the party's militancy finally endorses the document laying the foundations for a more autonomous, differentiated and remote Podemos project led by Yolanda Díaz.","The militancy of the Morada formation votes the new roadmap of the party that, among other elements, poses its autonomy with regard to Yolanda Díaz
We conclude on Saturday the process of renewing the roadmap that will follow the party during the next legislature. In September, Ione Belarra launched a document with a series of bases that set the strategy of the organization and corrected the course it took in its last Citizen Assembly, in which Belarra was appointed as secretary general.
At that conclave, held in 2021, it was decided to bet decisively for Yolanda Díaz to take over the leadership of the space of Unidas Podemos. Two years later, the political situation has changed a lot, the relations between Belarra and Díaz, and between Podemos and Sumar, are not the same, and the Morada formation considers that it is time to draw a new path that collects the current scene.
The document has received numerous contributions from the militancy at different territorial levels, and after an open debate process is now submitted to the voting of the registered (who will decide whether or not to validate the text between Thursday and Friday). Finally, on Saturday, Belarra will present the results of the vote at a political conference that Podemos celebrates in Madrid.
The document sets the keys on which the organization will sit in the face of the next legislature and, at least, until a citizen assembly is held to renew positions and objectives. The main keys are the identity rearm and reinforcement of Podemos, the strategic and political autonomy of Belarra against Sumar, and the new rules that the party will follow when drawing alliances with other formations.
“It is important to continue to work so that Podemosins its differentiating identity within the progressive bloc. An identity that has led us to changes that seemed impossible and that will lead us to continue pushing the transformations much further,” reads one of the militancy’s contributions accepted and included in the final document that will be submitted to vote.
Autonomy and prohibition of double militance
Also with regard to its position in this bloc, the text recognises the “responsibility to protect our autonomy as a differentiated political force and our ability to make decisions” and, the report continues, “we must not renounce to raise our voice or to concrete a transformative and autonomous project with the ability to lead without folding or losing our autonomy against other formations.”
In this section of political autonomy, the original wording that prohibits the double militance of the registered members of Podemos (for example, military at the same time in Podemos and Sumar) isined and it is added that this will not be allowed “in any case”. It also introduces as a mandate the impossibility of “dissolving” in other parties or spaces.
“Podemos is an autonomous political force with its own voice, which will always have its own roadmap, its program, its management bodies and its decision-making mechanisms protagonized by the militants and the registered. In no case will it be dissolved in another party,” the report said.
The autonomy and differentiation with respect to Sumar is also strategic. The Podemos document sharply rejects the discourses contrary to “noise” and “polarization” that leadership such as the government’s second vice president, Yolanda Díaz, has flattered.
“Front those political interests and media speakers, we claim the noise, which means not to silence before injustice and raise the voice with the aim of achieving the advances that our country needs”; “the ordinary people always have little to win in the closed-door offices and much to win when debates open to the street. “Without noise, a coalition government is a step back and assimilation of the most transformative force to the most conservative,” the document said.
“Polarization” and “Noise”
“Polarization has been posed as an equalization between democratic change and antidemocratic reaction, as a sparkling scale in which the two extremes are, on the one hand, social justice and, on the other, fascism. That notion of polarization is false and enemy of democratic advances. Polarization is not the relationship between advance and reaction, between social justice and the defense of privileges. The real polarization is inequality,” the report said.
With regard to alliances with other political formations, coalition governments and eventual support for investures, new rules are also established within the party. “To support or form part of any coalition government in the future must incorporate a substantial part of the Podemos program”, adds one of the contributions to the text, at a time when Belarra have defended that Sumar negotiated the coalition agreement with the PSOE without having them and without incorporating their claims.
“In any case, the votes of the representatives of Podemos in the institutions must be negotiated and never gifted,” the text says, right at the doorstep of an eventual investidure of Pedro Sánchez. “The alliances with other political formations will be worked and articulated with the aim of maximizing our capacity for change from the institutions and always from mutual respect for the autonomy of the different political forces and with the celebration of open primaries.”
This Saturday at noon it will be known if the militance of the party finally approves the document that sets the foundations for a more autonomous, differentiated and away from the project led by Yolanda Díaz.",https://www.publico.es/es/politica/podemos-abre-una-nueva-etapa-para-desligarse-politica-y-estrategicamente-de-sumar/

9,La Audiencia Nacional abre juicio por terrorismo contra 12 miembros de los CDR,"La amnistía pactada entre PSOE y ERC incluye a los 12 activistas independentistas en el olvido judicial, pero la Audiencia valida el relato del juez instructor de una causa que arrancó en septiembre del 2019.
La sala penal de la Audiencia Nacional ha confirmado el sumario de la instrucción contra 12 activistas de los CDR -comités de defensa de la República- procesados en la denominada operación Judas y ha acordado la apertura de juicio oral contra ellos bajo la acusación de pertenencia a organización terrorista. La decisión llega cuando se está pendiente de que se cierre el acuerdo definitivo para la Ley de amnistía entre PSOE y Junts, pero el entendimiento al que ya llegaron los socialistas y republicanos sobre la normativa incorpora la causa contra los CDR, que se beneficiarían del olvido judicial. Si la amnistía sale adelante, por tanto, los activistas independentistas no serían juzgados por la Audiencia Nacional.
En concreto, la sala penal ha confirmado la resolución del sumario de la causa dictado en abril por el juzgado de instrucción número 6 de la propia Audiencia. Aparte de procesarlos por pertenencia a organización terrorista, a ocho de los CDR también les atribuye el delito de tenencia, depósito y fabricación de explosivos de carácter terrorista. La instrucción del magistrado atribuía a los activistas la pertenencia a un fantasmal -y desconocido- Equipo de Respuesta Táctica (ERT), un grupúsculo que, siempre según su interpretación, pretendía conseguir la independencia de Catalunya a través de acciones violentas.
La operación Judas se desarrolló inicialmente el 23 de septiembre de 2019, con varios registros y nueve detenciones en casas de municipios del Vallès Occidental, Vallès Oriental y Osona. Por último, el volumen de detenidos llegarían a ser 13, pero uno de los casos ya fue archivado hace un año y medio. De los primeros detenidos, siete fueron encarcelados preventivamente durante tres meses en Soto del Real, centro del cual salieron en libertad bajo fianza.
La operación generó una fuerte movilización en contra, con manifestaciones y actos de apoyo a los detenidos que en algunos casos reunieron a miles de personas. Pese a que el relato acusador ha ido perdiendo fuerza ante la falta de pruebas y la denuncia de irregularidades del Proceso que han hecho entidades como Alerta Solidaria, la Audiencia Nacional ha decidido echar por el derecho y abrir juicio contra los activistas. Un juicio que la amnistía estaría cerca de enterrar.","The amnesty agreed between PSOE and ERC includes the 12 independence activists in judicial oblivion, but the audience validates the story of the investigating judge of a case that started in September 2019.
