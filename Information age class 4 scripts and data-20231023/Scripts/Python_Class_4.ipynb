A battle for our home, this is not an exaggeration, this is the war. It's do or die - they need to die,\" he said.He warned Hezbollah not to enter the war.\"[Hezbollah] will be making the biggest mistake of their lives. And we will hit them with an unimaginable force. It will mean devastation for them and the state of Lebanon,\" he said.For its part, Hezbollah has declared that it is \"fully ready to fight against Israel\".At least 27 people have been reported killed in southern Lebanon during exchanges of fire between Israel and Hamas. At least five Israeli soldiers and one civilian have been killed in Israel, according to Israeli military reports.Israel has ordered dozens of northern communities to evacuate, adding 14 more on Sunday.And in neighbouring Syria - where Iran has a military presence - Israeli missiles hit Damascus and Aleppo international airports early on Sunday, killing at least two workers, according to Syrian state media.Both airports have been taken out of use given the damage to their runways.More on Israel-Gaza warFollow live: Latest updatesExplained: What evidence tell us about Al-Ahli hospital blastHistory behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: The forgotten Israelis kept by Hamas in GazaWest Bank: Palestinians under attack as Israeli settler violence surgesRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelIranMore on this storyIsrael Gaza war: History of the conflict explainedPublished2 days agoWest Bank Palestinians hit by surge of Israeli settler attacksPublished2 days agoTop StoriesLive.Â Israel says soldiers carry out 'limited raids' in GazaDead and wounded strain Gaza hospitals as air strikes intensifyPublished1 hour agoArgentina minister defies polls in first-round votePublished2 hours agoFeaturesMy daughters beg to go home - but our old lives in Gaza City are overStricter rules for India student hub after suicidesWhy the Philippines and China are on a collision courseThe Maldives' new leader wants Indian troops to leaveIsrael Gaza war: History of the conflict explainedGaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live thereSteely gaze of endangered tigress tops mangrove photo awardsWhy being bilingual is good for your brain.
